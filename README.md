# DynamicArrayLib
C implementation of a dynamic array

Just put those source files in your project and it will work. It is not meant to be used as a shared library since the source code is relatively small.

You can test it by executing ```build_tests.sh``` to build a simple test executable statically linked to the library.

## Compatibility
This library is compatible with C99-compliant compilers.

## Licensing
This library is licensed under GNU LGPL Version 3.
